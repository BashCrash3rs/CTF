The first challenge in the Keeber series tells us the following:

"You have been applying to entry-level cybersecurity jobs focused on reconnaissance and open source intelligence (OSINT). Great news! You got an interview with a small cybersecurity company; the Keeber Security Group.
Before interviewing, they want to test your skills through a series of challenges oriented around investigating the Keeber Security Group.

The first step in your investigation is to find more information about the company itself. All we know is that the company is named Keeber Security Group and they are a cybersecurity startup.
To start, help us find the person who registered their domain. The flag is in regular format."

## <- Solution ->
Easy enough, we Google to find the website of the company at this address: https://keebersecuritygroup.com/

Now we head over to our terminal and run a quick WHOIS check with <code>whois keebersecuritygroup.com</code> to check the registrant information on WHOIS and we find our flag waiting for us in the Admin Name field.
